This file is a collection of Vim functions I have written, many of them in
response to questions posted on the vim users' list.  They are all reasonably
short, so I hope they will be good examples if you are trying to learn how to
write your own Vim functions.  You may even find some of the functions
useful, such as the :Range command and the Mark(), Common(), Count(),
GetModelines(), VarTab(), and SmartBS() functions.
